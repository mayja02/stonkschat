   1. Original Post: "A reader webapp (and potentially commenting too) for the daily thread that breaks up the total list of comments into multiple vertical columns. Think 5 twitch chats next to eachother, leftmost is the oldest users, it's slower, the chat is allegedly more informative, and as you go right the sort changes, where the rightmost is basically twitch chat with new users. The user can change the sort from things like age left to right, karma left to right, and filter with new/top/etc"
